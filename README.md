## Hi there üëã who am I?

#### My name is Jaime, I recently graduated from the University of Plymouth with a Bachelors in Computer Science (Hons) where I obtained a first. During my degree I completed a placement year in industry at the [Plymouth Marine Laboratory](https://www.pml.ac.uk/). Over the course of this placement, I got the opportunity to work and collaborate on several datascience projects as part of the international [MONOCLE](https://www.pml.ac.uk/Research/Projects/MONOCLE) project, where my work focused specifically on creating software to operate on raspberry pi which would be distributed to in-situ locations, to decode readings live from multiple in-situ devices simultaneously.

## ‚úçÔ∏è What I'm learning

#### I'm currently interested in expanding my subject knowledge by learning new technologies such as AWS by completing the [training courses](https://www.aws.training/) and gain certification, as well as automation such as Terraform. Secondly, to improving upon my existing self taught materials such as machine learning, which was the focus of [dissertation project](https://github.com/JaimeKB/Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM-NN), stockmarket forcasting using LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural networks. Thirdly, I want to refine what I learned at university such as front-end development so I can deliver clean and professional-grade technologies.
