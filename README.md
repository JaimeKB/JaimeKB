## Hi there üëã who am I?

My name is Jaime, I recently graduated from the University of Plymouth with a Bachelors in Computer Science (Hons) where I obtained a first. During my degree I completed a placement year in industry at the [Plymouth Marine Laboratory](https://www.pml.ac.uk/). Over the course of this placement, I got the opportunity to work and collaborate on several datascience projects as part of the international [MONOCLE](https://www.pml.ac.uk/Research/Projects/MONOCLE) project, where my work focused specifically on creating software to operate on raspberry pi which would be distributed to in-situ locations, to decode readings live from multiple in-situ devices simultaneously. 

NOTE: This is the Github account I used during my placement for public repositories, and I have moved my two main projects over from my university Github account to here before it was deleted.

## ‚úçÔ∏è What I'm learning

I'm currently interested in expanding my subject knowledge by learning new technologies such as AWS by completing the [training courses](https://www.aws.training/) and gain certification, as well as automation such as Terraform. Secondly, to improving upon my existing self taught materials such as machine learning, which was the focus of [dissertation project](https://github.com/JaimeKB/Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM-NN), stockmarket forcasting using LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural networks. Thirdly, I want to refine what I learned at university such as front-end development so I can deliver clean and professional-grade technologies. Alongside this, I aim to complete personal projects in a variety of different programming languages, such as a hospital management system in Java using design patterns.

## ‚è© Some of my projects

### Stock Market Forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks in Python

As mentioned, this was my dissertation project, which I decided upon after seeing machine learning used in the datascience industry for the massive amounts of data gathered from observations. I chose the stock market since I've always had an interest in how finance works, and after some research I found several sources of historic stock data, which was all I needed to be able to do my project. Settling on recurrent neural networks, specifically sequencing I chose Long Short-Term Memory networks as there was a lot of research out there and it seemed to be a current point of interest. I chose Python since that was a language I got very farmiliar with during my placement year, and there were a lot of resources available for machine learning and data management. I'm proud to say that I achieved over 85% in this project, and I still see much room for improvement and expansion, possibly even turning this into a 3-5 year long project.

### SOS-box, a data decoder and logger for in-situ devices in Python

This project was my first long-term task while on placement, where the purpose was to develop a program to go on a raspberry pi out in-situ and connect to different types of legacy water sensors, to then decode and store the data locally, before transmitting the data to SOS capable servers.

When the program is run it will ask the user what sensors are connected, then create an object of each of those sensors, move them into their own threads so reading data can be done concurrently and so their reading timers don't interfere. After reading a line of data, it is formatted and then sent to the apropriate table in the database.

This project was developed on an internal github repository, and the publicly available code is only the first push to meet a deadline, and is therefore not up to date or formatted appropriately. It is also early on in my placement, and therefore no longer a reflection of my coding abilities or style.

### An online casino, in Javascript using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

Done as part of a module project for full-stack development, this project acts as a prototype for an online casino, hosting an online blackjack game with the dealer being AI controlled. While it is more a proof-of-concept type of project, it shows the potential of a full-stack project, and will continue to be worked on as a personal project. This used solely JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, along with Ajax and Bootstrap, and was connected to a Mongo database for storing user data and online credits available. It was also connected to a paypal sandbox to show it could work with real currancy if upgraded to an industry software.

## üîß Technologies and Tools

#### Some of the programming languages and tools I've used and am comfortable with, there are more technologies that I will add over time, these are the main ones.

## Fun facts about me 

While at University I was the vice-president of the Ice Skating club for a year, and successfully managed the other members when the official club president all but stepped down, and was able to deliver consistent skating sessions every week, going on for more than previous years, and bringing in more money, doubling the amount left for the next year than our year started with. Since the ice skating club was the second most expensive club among all the sports clubs at the university, to be so far in the positive financially was a major achievement, and I also managed networking between other clubs and societies to increase our club awareness and create future contacts, all whilest providing events and opportunities for our members to try new things and meet new people.

I enjoy a variety of sports, from martial arts to table tennis, currently looking to find people and a place to learn squash üéæ

I enjoy playing board games, looking to getting into D&D üé≤
